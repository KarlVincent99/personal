    <h1>Dear Baby,</h1>
    <p>
        I just want to apologize for not being aware enough of your feelings and for not making any improvements. 
        I know my lack awareness on how you feel may have you caused you unheard is this correct. I'm sorry for not not being thoughtful, for not trying harder to communicate my best, and for the mistakes I've made. 
        I recognized my wrongdoings and I truly regret them. I'm also sorry for not making the effort to see what the problem really was. I know you gave me many chances, and I regret not valuing them the way I should have. 
        From now on, I promise to listen more carefully, to understand the problems instead of overlooking them. and to do my best to communicate openly and honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
        I know you're tired, and I take responsibility that. I don't want to keep making the same mistakes. I'm ready to listen and change, but I'll also respect whatever you need right now. 
        I know I've made things worse by talking too much. I'm sorry for not trying to see what the real problem was. I regret that I've hurt you that much and I want to understand you better.
    </p>
    <p>
        I understand that you don’t want to talk to me right now because 
        I haven’t fully understood your feelings, and I can see that you’re upset.
        I’m not writing this to force a conversation or to pressure you in any way — 
        I just want to take responsibility for my actions.
    </p>
    <p>
        I know that change is shown through actions, not just words. I am reflecting on my behavior and working on becoming more aware, more patient, and more supportive. 
        I want to truly listen and validate your feelings in the moment so that you never feel unheard again. 
        I care about you deeply, and I am truly sorry for the pain I caused.
    </p>

        Sincerely apologizing<br>
        Karl
